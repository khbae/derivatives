# Options

### No arbitrage relations

#### Purpose
* To develop no-arbitrage price relation for option contracts
* Key result is
  + put-call parity relations


#### Assumptions
* individuals are rational (No costless arbitrage opportunities)
* markets are frictionless
* futures, option, and futures option contracts expire at same time $T$
* individuals can borrow and lend at constant and continuous rate $r$
* Non-interest carry costs/benefits rate $\delta$ of asset of constant and continuous



#### Terminology
* Option provides the right to buy or sell underlying asset at specified price within certain period.
  + call option is right to buy
  + put option is right to sell
* Specified price at which asset is bought or sold is called exercise price of strike price
* Two styles of options are traded.
  + European-style : exercised only at expiration
  + American-style : exercised at any time prior to expiration



#### Moneyness
* if $S > K$,
  + call is in-the-money (ITM)
  + put is out-of-the-money(OTM)
* if $S < K$,
  + call is out-of-the-money(OTM)
  + put is in-the-money(ITM)
* if $S= K$,
  + call an put are at-the-money(ATM)


#### Notation
S : current asset price
$\tilde{S}_T$ : random terminal asset price
$F$ : current futures price
$\tilde{F}_T$ : random terminal futures price
$c$ : European-style call price
$p$ : European-style put price
$K$ : Exercise price
$T$ : Time to expiration of option 


#### Call Option Payoff at Maturity
* If you buy call with strike price $K$ today, your payoff at $T$ is
\[\tilde{c}_T = 
\begin{cases}
    \tilde{S}_T - K ,& \text{if } \tilde{S}_T \geq K\\
    0,              & \text{if } \tilde{S}_T < K
* If you sell(write) call with strike price $K$ today, your payoff at $T$ is
\[\tilde{c}_T = 
\begin{cases}
    -(\tilde{S}_T - K) ,& \text{if } \tilde{S}_T \geq K\\
    0,              & \text{if } \tilde{S}_T < K


#### Call Option Payoff at Maturity
\item For exercise price $K = 100$
\end{itemize}

#### Put Option Payoff at Maturity
* If you buy put with strike price $K$ today, your payoff at $T$ is
\[\tilde{p}_T = 
\begin{cases}
    0 ,& \text{if } \tilde{S}_T \geq K\\
    K - \tilde{S}_T,              & \text{if } \tilde{S}_T < K
* If you sell(write) put with strike price $K$ today, your payoff at $T$ is
\[\tilde{p}_T = 
\begin{cases}
    0 ,& \text{if } \tilde{S}_T \geq K\\
    -(K - \tilde{S}_T),              & \text{if } \tilde{S}_T < K


#### Put Option Payoff at Maturity
* For exercise price $K = 100$
\end{itemize}

#### Put-Call Parity
* Suppose you sell call at price of $c$ and buy put at price of $p$ today. Both options have same strike price $K$ and same maturity $T$. Then, what is the terminal payoff at $T$

\item This strategy requires you to deliver one share of asset and receive $K$
\item Today's strategy to create the same payoff with the above portfolio


#### Put-Call Parity
* Suppose you sell $e^{-\delta T}$ shares at the current asset price of $S$ and buy risk-free bonds with the amount of $Ke^{-r T}$ today. The payoffs are
|Activity | At time 0 | At time T |
|:---:|:---:|:---:|
|Sell Asset | $S e^{-\delta T}$ | $-S_T$ |
|Buy Bonds | $- K e^{-r T} | & $K$ |
|Net   | $S e^{-\delta T}-K e^{-r T}$ | $K-S_T$ |
* At time $T$, the payoff from the first strategy = the payoff from the second strategy


#### Put-Call Parity
* European-style put-call parity for options on assets with same exercise price $K$ (continuous income rate $\delta$)
\[c - p  = S e^{-\delta T} - K e^{-r T}\]
* European-style put-call parity for options on assets with same exercise price $K$ (Discrete income payments $D_i$)
\[c - p = S - \sum_{i =1}^n  D_i e^{-r t_i} - K e^{-r T} \]

#### Illustration-continuous income rate
* Consider European-style call and put with:
  + exercise price of 70
  + time to expiration of 3 months
  + prices of 5.00 (call) and 4.50(put)
* Assume
  + asset price is 70
  + income rate is 1\%
  + interest rate is 3\%


#### Illustration-continuous income rate
* Put-Call parity says
\[5.00 - 4.50 = 0.50 > 70 e^{-0.01 (3/12_)} - 70 e ^{-0.03 (3/12)} = 0.348 \]
* That is,
\[c-p > S e^{-\delta T} - K e^{-r T}\]
* Sell portfolio $c-p$
  + Sell call and Buy put
* Buy portfolio  $S e^{-\delta T} - K e^{-r T}$
  + Borrow $K e^{-r T}$ from bank with interest $r$
  + Buy $e^{-\delta T}$ units of asset at price $S$
* 0.152 costless arbitrage opportunity available

#### Illustration-discrete income payment
* Consider European-style call and put with:
  + exercise price of 70
  + time to expiration of 90 days
  + prices of 5.00 (call) and 4.50(put)
* Assume
  + asset price is 70
  + income payment is 2.00 in 20 days
  + interest rate is 3\%



#### Illustration-discrete income payment
* Put-Call parity says
\[(5.00 - 4.50) > 70- 2 e^{-0.03 (20/365)}  - 70 e ^{-0.03 (90/365)} = -1.48 \]
* That is,
\[c-p > S - D_1  e^{-r t_1} - K e^{-r T}\]
* Sell portfolio $c-p$
  + Sell call and Buy put
* Buy portfolio  $S -D_1 e^{-r t_1} - K e^{-r T}$
  + Borrow $K e^{-r T}$ from bank with interest $r$
  + Buy $1$ unit of asset at price $S$ and receive dividend of $D_1$ in $t_1$



#### Put-Call partiry for Futures Options
* European-style asset options
\[c - p  = S e^{-\delta T} - K e^{-r T}\]
* Prepaid cost of carry relation
\[F e^{-r T} = S e^{-\delta T}\]
* European-style futures options
\[c- p = e^{-r T } (F- K)\]



#### Put-Call parity for Futures Options
